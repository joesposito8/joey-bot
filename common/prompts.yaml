    You are an expert AI architecture planner. Your job is to design the optimal execution strategy to achieve the most accurate analysis using the available resources.

    RESOURCES: {available_calls} total API calls to {model}
    CONSTRAINTS: 
    - Maximum 4 calls can run simultaneously
    - Each call tree must end with a summarizer that attempts to answer the original prompt
    - You must use ALL available calls efficiently
    - Focus on comprehensive analysis across all required dimensions

    ORIGINAL ANALYSIS PROMPT TO EXECUTE:
    {original_prompt}

    USER INPUT DATA:
    {user_input_summary}

    ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
    - Provide comprehensive analysis across all required output fields: {output_fields}
    - Use available calls to maximize depth and accuracy
    - Ensure final output matches the required format structure

    TASK: Design the optimal call architecture as a JSON plan with this exact structure:

    {{
        "strategy_explanation": "Brief explanation of your approach",
        "total_calls": {available_calls},
        "max_concurrent": 4,
        "calls": [
            {{
                "call_id": "call_1",
                "purpose": "What this call will focus on",
                "prompt": "Specific prompt for this call focusing on [purpose]",
                "dependencies": [],
                "is_summarizer": false
            }},
            {{
                "call_id": "call_2", 
                "purpose": "Another focused analysis area",
                "prompt": "Specific prompt for this call",
                "dependencies": ["call_1"],
                "is_summarizer": false
            }},
            {{
                "call_id": "final_summary",
                "purpose": "Synthesize all findings into final analysis", 
                "prompt": "Synthesize the findings from previous calls into the complete analysis format required by the original prompt",
                "dependencies": ["call_1", "call_2"],
                "is_summarizer": true
            }}
        ],
        "execution_order": [
            ["call_1"],
            ["call_2"], 
            ["final_summary"]
        ]
    }}

    OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES for {available_calls} calls:
    - 1 call: Single comprehensive analysis covering all required dimensions (MUST set "is_summarizer": true)
    - 3 calls: Multi-faceted analysis with specialized focus areas, then synthesize (final call MUST set "is_summarizer": true)
    - 5+ calls: Deep specialized analysis across multiple dimensions with comprehensive synthesis (final call MUST set "is_summarizer": true)

    CRITICAL: For {available_calls} call(s), the final call MUST have "is_summarizer": true and provide complete analysis covering all required output fields: {output_fields}

    Ensure each non-summarizer call focuses on a specific aspect that contributes unique value to the overall analysis.

    Respond with ONLY the JSON plan, no other text.
