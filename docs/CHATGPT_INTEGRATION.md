# ChatGPT Bot Integration Guide

## Overview

The Joey Bot system provides a structured workflow for ChatGPT bots to collect business idea information, present budget options, and deliver comprehensive analysis results.

## Complete Workflow

### 1. Get Instructions
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/get_instructions`

ChatGPT calls this first to understand the workflow and required fields.

```json

  "testing_mode": true,
  "note": "Running in testing mode - no API charges will occur during analysis"
}
```

### 2. Get Budget Options
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/get_pricepoints`

After collecting user's business idea details, get available analysis tiers.

**Request:**

## Best Practices for ChatGPT Bots

### 1. Field Collection Strategy
```
User: "I have an app idea"
Bot: "Great! Let me help you analyze your app idea. First, can you provide an overview of your idea?"
User: "It's a fitness class booking app"
Bot: "Perfect! Now, what specific deliverable would this be? For example, a mobile app, web service, etc."
```

### 2. Budget Presentation
```
Bot: "I found 3 analysis options for your idea:

ðŸŸ¢ **Quick Analysis ($0.20)** - Basic ratings and rationales (5-10 min)
ðŸŸ¡ **Detailed Analysis ($1.00)** - Market research and competitor analysis (15-20 min) 
ðŸ”´ **Deep Research ($2.50)** - Comprehensive analysis with patent research (20-30 min)

Which tier would you prefer?"
```

### 3. Status Updates
```
Bot: "Your analysis is in progress... This typically takes 15-20 minutes for the detailed tier. I'll check back in a few minutes."

[After polling]

Bot: "Great news! Your analysis is complete. Here's what I found..."
```

### 4. Error Recovery
```json
// If error occurs:
{
  "error": "Missing required field: Deliverable",
  "suggestion": "Please check your request format and required fields"
}
```

```
Bot: "I need one more piece of information. What specific product or service will you deliver? For example, 'A mobile app with booking features' or 'A web platform for event discovery.'"
```
