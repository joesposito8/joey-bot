2. **Agent Configuration Migration**: Convert business_evaluation.yaml to new universal format
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Validate complete workflow with business evaluation agent using real API
4. **Second Agent Creation**: Prove universality by creating HR analysis agent
5. **Test Isolation Fixes**: Address remaining 2 test failures that occur only in full suite runs

## Key Dependencies

- **Agent Parameter Support**: Required for Azure Functions to work with multiple agent types
- **Google Sheets Schema**: Must maintain compatibility with dynamic schema loading (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Real API Integration**: All components now use real Google Sheets API (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Test Infrastructure**: Stable foundation for development (✅ COMPLETED)

## Risk Mitigation
