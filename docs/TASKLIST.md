- [x] Consolidate universal templates and budget tiers in platform.yaml
- [x] Update FullAgentConfig to use universal prompt system
- [x] Create unified error handling system in common/errors.py
- [x] Remove UniversalAgentEngine in favor of existing AnalysisService
- [x] Update system architecture docs to reflect current state
<!-- Updated from commit 2f23a48 -->

## Pending Tasks

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Current Priority)

#### Universal Platform Foundation
- [x] Create `platform.yaml` with universal configuration for ALL agents
- [ ] Enhance `common/agent_service.py` with improved configuration support
- [ ] Create `common/config.py` for universal configuration loading system
- [ ] Implement `common/workflow.py` for universal multi-call workflow execution

#### Azure Functions Universal Updates
- [ ] Update `idea-guy/get_instructions/__init__.py` to accept agent parameter
- [ ] Modify `idea-guy/get_pricepoints/__init__.py` to use AnalysisService
- [ ] Update `idea-guy/execute_analysis/__init__.py` to support any agent type
- [ ] Enhance `idea-guy/process_idea/__init__.py` to extract agent_id from job metadata

#### Agent Configuration Migration
- [ ] Convert `agents/business_evaluation.yaml` to new universal format
- [ ] Remove hardcoded business logic from agent configuration
- [ ] Test agent configuration loading with new universal system
- [ ] Validate dynamic schema loading from Google Sheets

### Core Functionality

- [ ] Complete AnalysisService implementation with execution planning
- [ ] Add test coverage for error handling scenarios
- [ ] Validate real Google Sheets integration with platform.yaml
<!-- Updated from commit 9fdb319 -->

#### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Fix import errors in new universal test files
- [ ] Update test imports to use AnalysisService
- [ ] Run 5 focused tests to validate universal system functionality
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass with TESTING_MODE=true (no API charges)
- [ ] Test end-to-end workflow with business evaluation agent

#### File Cleanup
- [ ] Delete `common/budget_config.py` after functionality moved to platform.yaml
- [ ] Remove unused imports and references to deleted files
- [ ] Update any remaining hardcoded references to business evaluation

### Integration & Edge Cases

#### System Validation
- [ ] Test universal system with existing business evaluation agent
- [ ] Verify Google Sheets schema loading works with new configuration system  
- [ ] Validate OpenAI multi-call architecture with AnalysisService
- [ ] Test cost tracking and logging with universal system

#### Production Readiness
- [ ] Test Azure Functions deployment with universal endpoints
- [ ] Verify environment variable handling in universal system
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases in universal configuration loading
- [ ] Validate backwards compatibility during transition period

### Phase 3: Validation & Polish (Future)

#### Second Agent Type Creation
- [ ] Create HR analysis agent configuration to prove universality
- [ ] Set up Google Sheet schema for HR agent type
- [ ] Test that same Azure Functions work for multiple agent types
- [ ] Document agent creation process for future agent types

#### Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Optimize configuration loading for multiple agent types
- [ ] Test multi-call architecture performance with universal templates
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed configuration data
- [ ] Monitor and optimize API response times

#### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update API.md to reflect universal endpoints with agent parameters
- [ ] Update TESTING.md for new 5-focused-test strategy
- [ ] Create agent creation guide for non-technical users
- [ ] Update troubleshooting guide for universal system

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Test Imports**: Resolve import errors in new universal tests by implementing missing classes
2. **Enhance Analysis Service**: Improve AnalysisService with universal configuration
3. **Update Azure Functions**: Add agent parameter support to all endpoints
4. **Test End-to-End**: Validate complete workflow with business evaluation agent
5. **Create Second Agent**: Prove universality by creating HR analysis agent

## Key Dependencies

- **AnalysisService Enhancement**: Required for tests to pass and universal system to function
- **Platform.yaml Creation**: Needed to consolidate universal configuration
- **Agent Parameter Support**: Required for Azure Functions to work with multiple agent types
- **Google Sheets Schema**: Must maintain compatibility with dynamic schema loading

## Risk Mitigation

- **Testing Mode**: All development uses TESTING_MODE=true to prevent API charges
- **Gradual Migration**: Keep existing business evaluation working during transition
- **Rollback Plan**: Original system preserved until universal system fully validated
- **Documentation First**: Complete documentation before implementation to ensure clarity
